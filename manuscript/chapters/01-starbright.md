# Starbright Saves the Day

## Dedication

To every kid who has ever wished on a star and then chased it anyway.

## Chapter 1: The Comet in the Closet

Twelve-year-old Maya Lopez was supposed to be asleep, but sleep and she
hadn't been speaking lately. The night outside her window smoldered in a
stormy violet, thunder rolling like distant drums. Every flash of
lightning made the glow-in-the-dark stars she'd stuck to her ceiling
pulse.

She sat cross-legged on the floor, goggles on her head, soldering iron
in hand. The "Imaginator"—a bundle of wires, repurposed bicycle bells,
and an old VR headset—was almost finished. It wasn't pretty, but it
promised what Maya wanted more than anything: a way to bring the
fantastical worlds in her sketchbook to life, even for just a few minutes.

Outside, the thunder cracked so loudly that the Imaginator rattled. Maya
looked up in time to see a streak of light hurtle past her window, as if
the storm had thrown a spark that forgot to burn out. A heartbeat later,
something thudded in her closet.

Maya grabbed the nearest flashlight, tore open the closet door, and froze.
Nestled between her soccer ball and a box of school art projects was a
round, glowing pebble with a dust-tail of shimmering sparkles. It
hummed—a chord that sounded like wind chimes drifting across a lake at
dawn.

"Uh, hello?" Maya whispered. "Please don't explode."

The pebble shook itself like a pup after a bath. Its glow stretched, its
sparkles spun, and it elongated into something that could only be called
an extremely small comet with expressive eyebrows.

"I am Starbright," it announced, voice ringing inside her head like the
clearest bell. "Junior courier of the Cosmic Mail Service."

"You're a comet," Maya said.

"A comet who is very much behind schedule," Starbright replied. "Also, I
crashed in your closet. I apologize for any inconvenience."

Maya's brain sprinted in seven directions. She checked the soldering iron
(unplugged), the fire alarm (quiet), and the door (definitely locked). If
this was a dream, it was the best and weirdest one she'd ever had.

"Can you... go back to space?" she asked.

Starbright dimmed. "Not yet. My flight path requires a momentum recharge.
I was supposed to skim the Aurora Expressway, but your Imaginator pulled
me off course."

Maya blinked. "My what now?"

The comet bobbed toward her invention. "This device leaks daydream
energy. It's potent stuff. You must be an excellent imaginer."

Maya tried not to blush. "You really think so?"

"Positively. With your permission, we can use the Imaginator to refuel.
In return, I can offer you a favor—one magical special delivery."

A real comet courier was offering her a wish. Maya's heart ricocheted
against her ribs like a pinball. But the Imaginator was still untested.
"What if it doesn't work?"

Starbright's tail sparked. "Then we will improvise."

## Chapter 2: Delivery for the Whole Town

By morning the storm had passed, leaving the town of Pine Ridge wrapped in
fog. Maya's mom had already left for her shift at the bakery, and her dad
was calibrating weather sensors for the news station. That meant Maya had
exactly four hours to help a comet charge up before she had to go to
soccer practice.

They set up the Imaginator on the back porch. Maya clipped solar panels
onto the device, tightened screws, and crossed her fingers.

"Ready?" she asked.

"As I'll ever be," Starbright said.

Maya flicked the switch. A low hum thrummed through the boards. The
Imaginator's lenses spun, projecting translucent sketches into the fog: a
creature with firefly wings, a kite shaped like a dragon, a fleet of
paper boats sailing on a rainbow river. Starbright absorbed each image,
after-image glittering along their surface.

"This is marvelous!" the comet cheered.

Maya's best friend, Jonah, coasted into the yard on his scooter. He wore
his usual expression of quiet curiosity.

"Why do you look like you slept even less than usual?" he asked.

"Because there's a comet on my porch," Maya said. "Do you see it?"

Jonah peered over her shoulder, eyes widening. "I do now. Cool. How can I
help?"

Maya caught him up, and soon Jonah was sketching whimsical gadgets to
feed the Imaginator. Starbright brightened with every picture, but the
charge still lagged.

"I need one surge," Starbright said. "A story so vivid it hums."

Maya hesitated. "There's something I haven't drawn yet. It's the story of
Maple Lane."

Pine Ridge had been quiet lately. The old toy shop had closed, the summer
parade was canceled, and the neighborhood kids spent more time staring at
screens than chasing fireflies. Maple Lane, once bright with chalk
artwork and backyard forts, felt dim.

"Then let's rekindle it," Jonah said.

Maya breathed in. She pictured Maple Lane during the night of a meteor
shower, kids gathering with jars of starlight, grandmas telling stories,
parents playing guitars, the whole town letting imagination lead for one
night. She drew until her pencil smudged her fingers, then fed the
sketches into the Imaginator.

The projector bloomed. Maple Lane came alive in shimmering light. Kids
laughed, neighbors cheered, and even the mailboxes swayed to the music.
Starbright glowed so bright that Maya had to shield her eyes.

"Charge complete!" the comet sang.

"Before you go," Maya said, "can your delivery help everyone remember how
to imagine again?"

Starbright twirled in the air. "I can send a Stardrop—a spark that
inspires joy wherever it lands. I'll set the destination to Pine Ridge's
heart."

The comet zipped upward, looped twice, and released a tiny crystal that
drifted down like a slow snowflake. It settled on the town's tallest
maple tree. Instantly, golden leaves unfurled even though it was summer,
and the branches swayed into the shape of outstretched arms.

"It is done," Starbright said. "May your imagination stay curious."

Maya swallowed the lump in her throat. "Will you visit again?"

"Send a daydream through the Imaginator," Starbright replied. "I'll
keep an ear out."

Then the comet rocketed skyward, streaking beyond the clouds. The fog
parted, revealing a sky polished to crystal blue.

That afternoon, Pine Ridge buzzed like a festival. The bakery sold comet
cupcakes. Jonah's little sister organized an instant art show. Kids raced
handmade scooters down Maple Lane, their helmets decorated with glittery
stars.

As the sun dipped, Maya stood beneath the maple tree, now strung with
lights. She lifted her goggles and smiled at Jonah.

"Think they'll keep imagining tomorrow?" she asked.

Jonah shrugged. "We'll remind them if they forget."

Maya slipped the Imaginator into her backpack. It was no longer just a
bundle of wires—it was her promise to share daydreams.

Above them, a faint streak of light winked. Perhaps it was an airplane,
or maybe Starbright waving goodbye. Either way, Pine Ridge was glowing
again, and Maya knew the story was only beginning.
